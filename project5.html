          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In this experiment, we need to implement raytracing using opengl and C++</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar to the third experiment, I don't change too much of the source code.</p>
          <p class="textimg"><img src="images/5_0.png"></p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;When a ray hits a surface, it can generate up to three new types of rays: reflection, 
          	refraction, and shadow.A reflection ray is traced in the mirror-reflection direction. 
          	The closest object it intersects is what will be seen in the reflection. Refraction rays 
          	traveling through transparent material work similarly, with the addition that a refractive 
          	ray could be entering or exiting a material. A shadow ray is traced toward each light. If 
          	any opaque object is found between the surface and the light, the surface is in shadow and 
          	the light does not illuminate it. The ray tracing added more realism to ray traced images </p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; To acculate the speed of rendering , I take the adaptive depth control,which means that we stop generating reflected/transmitted rays 
          	when the computed intensity becomes less than a certain threshold. We must always set a certain maximum depth or else the program would generate an infinite 
          	number of rays. But it is not always necessary to go to the maximum depth if the surfaces are not highly reflective. To test for this the ray tracer must 
          	compute and keep the product of the global and reflection coefficients as the rays are traced.Example: let Kr = 0.5 for a set of surfaces. Then from the 
          	first surface the maximum contribution is 0.5, for the reflection from the second: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25, the third: 0.25 * 0.5 = 0.125, the fourth: 0.125 * 0.5 = 0.0625, 
          	the fifth: 0.0625 * 0.5 = 0.03125, etc. In addition we might implement a distance attenuation factor such as 1/D2, which would also decrease the intensity contribution.
            </p>
          <p class="textimg"></p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;To acculate the speed of rendering, I enclose groups of objects in sets of hierarchical bounding volumes 
          	and first test for intersection with the bounding volume, and then only 
          	if there is an intersection, against the objects enclosed by the volume.Bounding volumes should
          	 be easy to test for intersection, for example a sphere or box (slab). The best bounding volume
          	  will be determined by the shape of the underlying object or objects. For example, if the 
          	  objects are long and thin then a sphere will enclose mainly empty space and a box is much 
          	  better. Boxes are also easier for hierarchical bounding volumes.Note that using a 
          	  hierarchical system like this (assuming it is done carefully) changes the intersection 
          	  computational time from a linear dependence on the number of objects to something between 
          	  linear and a logarithmic dependence. This is because, for a perfect case, each intersection 
          	  test would divide the possibilities by two, and  a binary tree type structure is needed. 
          	  .
