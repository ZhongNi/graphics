<p>1. At the very start , my method is drawing the arm,body and leg in one function, then I found that the location of the parts became confusing and at that time , I used directed line . There is strong alising and make the man ugly. I think there must be a better choice so I stopped.</p>
<p>2. By consulting some classmate and reding some blogs, I found no one using the method mentioned above and most of them used packaging technique. Relizing that using packaging technique can make the code more accessible, I made the (x,y,z) as paramenters and defined function which can draw cubes using the parameters. As a result , the bear become more and more beautiful.</p>
<p>3. By using the mainloop() method, I define a variable ----angle, which stands for the angle of the bear. When rendering, the angle increases by one. Once the angle reached 360, then push the bear to the initial position and make the next rendering loop. As to the movment of the arm, I define two variables in an array----arm[1]&arm[2],which stand for the angle of the big arm and the small arm. To simple the question, I make both of them increase by 1 each time. Also , there are two boolean varibles which control the direction of the arm-----1 means the arm is moving ahead and 0 means the arm is moving back. When the angle variables reach to the biggest angle, the boolean variables value change. The movment of the leag is similar to the arms.</p>
<p>4.The light point of this project is that I added texture to the bear. The related code of texture is found on the Internet, I did't understand it totally. But I finally added the texture to the bear!</p>
